# Homebrew-Beer-Analysis
Analysis Project about Homebrewed Beer using a Kaggle Dataset.

****This assignment has now turned into a personal project that I use to practice Python, R, and SQL in my spare time. Please check my files and review for lately work!

This project was for a Data Wrangling assignment. I chose homebrewed beer because well, I'm a geologist and it's apart of the job description. 

I found a dataset to work on that was in pretty rough shape, but it had plenty of information and was challenging enough to really learn from. 

The assignment requirements were as follows:
- Create one or more CSV or TSV files that include data that you are interested in working on from your data-set.
- Create one or more JSON files that include data that you are interested in working on from your data set.
- Write a program that can convert your data set from JSON to CSV, and another program that converts CSV back to JSON
- Load your data into a tool which will allow you to do analysis of your data. (I used R)
- Show evidence that I'm able to do basic operations on the data in your data package
- Create a professional report following the OSEMN process with name, title, problem statement and a few sentences for each process step or why a step does not apply, with code examples.
  - ( I have uploaded this as a seperate file with far more explanation than what is offered in this ReadMe)
